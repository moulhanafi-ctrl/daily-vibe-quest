   - Supabase Free Tier: 50 connection limit
   - May exhaust under load testing
   - RLS policies add query overhead

5. **Safari Private Mode Detection**
   - Warning shown but need to verify on iOS
   - LocalStorage test might not catch all cases

6. **Age Group Content Filtering**
   - Verify appropriate content shown to minors
   - Parent verification flow must be tested
   - Journal privacy notice enforcement

7. **First-Time User Flow**
   - Language selection → Onboarding → Check-in → Journal
   - Multiple redirects, verify no loops
   - Query param handling (`?first_entry=true`)

8. **Mobile Keyboard Handling**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Testing)
1. ✅ **Deploy all edge functions** and verify they're responding
2. ✅ **Run Supabase linter** and fix critical RLS issues
3. ✅ **Create test user accounts** (all age groups)
4. ✅ **Verify Stripe test mode** is configured
5. ✅ **Set up monitoring dashboards** (Supabase, Sentry, PostHog)
6. ✅ **Acquire test devices** or remote device lab access
7. ✅ **Install Artillery or k6** for load testing

### Testing Priorities
1. **P0 Critical Path** (Must work before launch):
   - Signup → Onboarding → Check-in → Journal
   - Login → Dashboard
   - Chat Room (with subscription)
   - Store Checkout
   - Account Deletion

2. **P1 High Priority** (Should work before launch):
   - Voice recording in journal
   - AI suggestions
   - Push notifications
   - Data export
   - Customer portal

3. **P2 Medium Priority** (Can fix post-launch):
   - Offline behavior
   - Biometric auth
   - Landscape mode
   - Dark mode edge cases

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Database Connection Pool** - Monitor closely during load testing. May need to upgrade Supabase tier.
2. **Chat Realtime Scaling** - Test with 100+ concurrent users. Have rollback plan.
3. **Stripe Rate Limits** - Implement caching for subscription checks.
4. **Edge Function Cold Starts** - Monitor during load tests. Consider warming strategies.

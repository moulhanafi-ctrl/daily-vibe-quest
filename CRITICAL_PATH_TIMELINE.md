## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items (Could Delay Launch)

1. **App Store Rejection** (40% probability)
   - Mitigation: Over-prepare with detailed review notes
   - Buffer: 3-day resubmission window
   - Fallback: Soft launch to web only

2. **Critical Bug in Testing** (25% probability)
   - Mitigation: Start testing early (Day 3)
   - Buffer: 2 days for bug fixes
   - Fallback: Skip non-critical features

3. **Stripe Live Mode Issues** (15% probability)
   - Mitigation: Test thoroughly on Day 3
   - Buffer: Have Stripe support contact ready
   - Fallback: Launch without store initially

4. **Screenshot Quality Rejection** (20% probability)
   - Mitigation: Use professional design tools
   - Buffer: Can recreate in 1 day
   - Fallback: Use simulator screenshots

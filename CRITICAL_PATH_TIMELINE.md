## Risk Mitigation (Updated)

### High-Risk Items (Could Delay Launch)

1. **App Store Rejection** (35% probability) - REDUCED
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive review notes, all assets ready by Oct 31
   - Buffer: 2-day resubmission window built into timeline
   - Fallback: Soft launch to web only, resubmit quickly

2. **Critical Bug in Testing** (20% probability) - REDUCED
   - Mitigation: Testing starts Day 4 (Oct 25), full 2 days allocated
   - Buffer: Oct 28-30 for fixes if needed
   - Fallback: Patch post-launch for non-critical issues

3. **Stripe Live Mode Issues** (10% probability) - REDUCED
   - Mitigation: Full day allocated (Oct 28), test sandbox thoroughly first
   - Buffer: Have Stripe support contact ready
   - Fallback: Launch without store, add later

4. **Screenshot Quality Rejection** (15% probability) - REDUCED
   - Mitigation: Full day allocated (Oct 23), use Capacitor screenshots
   - Buffer: Can recreate same day if needed
   - Fallback: Use simulator screenshots as backup

5. **Timeline Slippage** (30% probability) - NEW
   - Mitigation: Daily progress tracking, adjust scope if falling behind
   - Buffer: P2 items can be dropped without blocking launch
   - Fallback: Push submission to Nov 2-3 (still launches Nov 8-10)

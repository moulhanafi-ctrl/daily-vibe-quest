## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Database Migration

The tables are created automatically via Supabase migrations. They're already set up with proper RLS policies.

### 2. Set Up Cron Jobs

Run the SQL in `SESSION_TRIVIA_CRON_SETUP.sql` to schedule:
- Weekly generation (Friday)
- Weekly publishing (Saturday)

### 3. Configure Secrets

Ensure these secrets are set in Supabase:
- `LOVABLE_API_KEY` - For AI question generation
- `CRON_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For HMAC signature verification

### 4. Add Navigation

Users can access Session Trivia at:
- `/trivia/sessions` - Main session trivia page
- `/trivia` - Traditional trivia (existing feature)

## Monitoring

### Check Generated Content

```sql
-- View recent sessions
SELECT 
  week_key,
  status,
  topics,
  jsonb_array_length(session_1_questions) as s1_count,
  jsonb_array_length(session_2_questions) as s2_count,
  jsonb_array_length(session_3_questions) as s3_count,
  created_at,
  published_at
FROM trivia_weekly_sessions
ORDER BY week_key DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check User Progress

```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  tsp.week_key,
  tsp.session_number,
  tsp.score,
  tsp.completed_at
FROM trivia_session_progress tsp
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = tsp.user_id
ORDER BY tsp.completed_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Monitor Cron Jobs

```sql
-- View job history
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details 
WHERE jobid IN (
  SELECT jobid FROM cron.job 
  WHERE jobname LIKE 'trivia%session%'
)
ORDER BY start_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
